# Moneyguru to GnuCash
This tool helps you migrate all your accounts and transactions from [Moneyguru](https://www.hardcoded.net/moneyguru) to [GnuCash](http://www.gnucash.org).

I've written this because exporting QIF files from MoneyGuru and then importing these from GnuCash resulted in frequent duplicated transactions, and with many years of transactions recorded, a manual fix (even with the help of GnuCash duplicates detection) would have been much slower and less fun than writing this tool.

# Credits
For this tool, I've put together code taken from here and there; you'll likely recognise stuff from [moneyguru](https://github.com/hsoft/moneyguru) and [GnuCash](https://github.com/Gnucash/gnucash) themselves, as well as [gnucash-qif-import](https://github.com/hjacobs/gnucash-qif-import) which serves a similar purpose but did not resolve my specific problem.

I also thank the authors of the mentioned tools for helping me do my accounting for so many years.
